 ## INSTRUCTIONS  
 
 The first screen displays the main page, there are three other screens that are accessed through the main page by clicking the boxes. 
 
  - The first one is a game with the goal for the student to avoid the geese and get to class before the time ends as the time marks the time
 left for the class to start. 

 The student is moved with key arrows, the game can be restarted with the 'r' key, and the main page is accessed with key letter 'm' to switch to the other screens. 
 
  - The second screen, has the objective of displaying uwaterloo quotes for student inspirations. 
 
 On that screen, each time the button on the left is pressed, the new quote is randomly selected and displayed on the right. 
 
  - The last one is a "Focus timer" for 25 minutes with the display of the current time.
 
 It starts as soon as the screen box option is clicked, just as the game, it is restarted with the 'r' key and paused if switched to the Main Page with the 'm' key.
