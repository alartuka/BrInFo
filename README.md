 INSTRUCTIONS
 
 My program is designed as a multi-functional program.
 The first screen displays the main page, there's three other screens that are accessed
 through the main page by clicking the boxes. The first one is a game with the goal for the student
 to avoid the geese and get to class before the time ends as the time marks the time
 left for the class to start. The student is moved with key arrows, the game can be
 restarted with the 'r' key, and the main page is accessed with key letter 'm' to switch to
 the other screens. The second screen, has the objective of displaying uwaterloo 
 quotes for student inspirations. On that screen, each time the button on the left
 is pressed, new quote is randomly selected and displayed on the right. The last one
 is a "Focus timer" for 25 minutes with the display of current time, and it starts as soon as 
 the screen box option is clicked, just as the game, it is restarted with 'r' key and paused if 
 swithced to the Main page with the 'm' key.
